# Linear-Regression
In this data, the energy analysis is performed using 12 different building shapes simulated in Ecotect. The goal is to predict the cooling load (y2 in the datasets).
Suppose we consider the following three models to predict the cooling load on this dataset, including 
1)Lasso regression, 
2) Ridge regression, and 
3) Elastic Net regression. 
Please use 5-fold cross validation to compare their performance based on mean squared error (MSE). To implement these models, you can use python and the sklearn packages
